## Evening Scalper Pro

Evening Scalper Pro is a Forex trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This code represents a simplified version of the robot's core strategy. It is designed to execute scalping trades during the American trading session on specific currency pairs.

### Product Description

Evening Scalper Pro is a professional Forex trading robot that aims to generate profits through scalping trades. Scalping is a short-term trading strategy that focuses on making small profits from frequent trades. This robot is optimized for trading during the American trading session, which is known for its high volatility and liquidity.

The robot's strategy is based on mean-reversion tendency. It identifies currency pairs that show signs of deviating from their mean value and takes advantage of potential reversals. The robot calculates entry and exit points based on this mean-reversion tendency, as well as profit targets and stop loss levels.

### How It Works

The robot's initialization function checks if the current trading session is the American trading session. If it is, the robot loops through a predefined list of currency pairs and executes the scalping strategy for each pair. It ensures that the strategy is not executed during the rollover period, which can be volatile and unpredictable.

The scalping strategy is executed by the `ExecuteScalpingStrategy` function. It first calculates the entry price, profit target, and stop loss levels based on the mean-reversion tendency of the currency pair. It then places a market order to enter the market with the calculated parameters.

After the order is placed, the robot waits for it to close. If the order is closed with a profit, it is closed with a red color. If the order is closed with a loss, it is closed with a blue color. The robot uses the `IsOrderClosed` function to check if the order is closed.

The `GetMeanReversionEntry`, `GetProfitTarget`, and `GetStopLoss` functions are used to calculate the entry price, profit target, and stop loss levels, respectively. In this simplified version of the code, the entry price is calculated as the current ask price minus 0.001, and the profit target and stop loss levels are calculated as the current ask price plus 0.002 and minus 0.003, respectively. In a real-world scenario, these calculations would be based on more sophisticated algorithms.

The `OnDeinit` function is called when the expert advisor is removed from the chart and can be used for any necessary deinitialization code. The `OnTick` function is called on each tick and can be used for any necessary tick handling code.
